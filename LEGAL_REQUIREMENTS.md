# Legal Requirements regarding Information Security Insights

## Protection of third party source code

T.b.d. with a legal council

## Indemnification

When a developer adds security insights to G360D, an indemnification will be requested for all other members of G360D. Should a third party sue G360D for copyright infringement, G360D will refer that party directly to the developer of that specific information security insight.

## Scope of service

Information Security Insight applications should only check the assets that have been explicitly specified by the user of the Information Seurity Insight application. It is explicitly not allowed to produce Information Security Insights for any assets other than the assets specified. If, in spite of this, computer infringement is detected, G360D will invoke the indemnity provided by the developer and will refer the party that discovered the computer infringement directly to the developer of that specific information security insight.

## Processing personal data

Information Security Insight applications that process personal data must make it clear to the user in advance what personal data is (potentially) being processed by, and that the user of the Information Security Insight application might have to enter into a data processing agreement with the owner of the assets for which the information security insight is produced.
